# TronxyBrainFood
This is a hub to share information and experience with our friend and nemesis the Tronxy 3D printer.

I have gleaned this information from the internet and a certain Tronxy Facebook group.


The main contributors are:

JEFF VICTOR

SCOTT WORTHINGTON

BILLIE RUBEN

ROBERT B. TERREY

KEITH VARIN


Without these contributors none of this information would be available or even exist.
 Thanks to all who have contributed (whether knowingly or not) this information and insight into the quirks and problems associated with a Tronxy printer.

I have started to expand this hub to include both CoreXY printers like the x5sa and Cartiage Style like the xy-2 pro. Learning the ins and outs of these printers and the Chitu Firmware is the sole purpose of this GitHub. 
 

For more information and insight into the Chitu Firmware Check out:
