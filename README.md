# TronxyBrainFood
This is a hub to share information and experience with our friend and nemesis the Tronxy XY-2 Pro 3D printer.

I have gleaned this information from the internet and a certain Tronxy Facebook group.

*\0/* IMPORTANT NOTICE *\0/*

Most of the files are only compatible with; The TITAN or Standard Extruder, V6 - CXY-191017 - Black Main Board.

The main contributors are:

JEFF VICTOR

SCOTT WORTHINGTON

BILLIE RUBEN

ROBERT B. TERREY

KEITH VARIN


Without these contributors none of this information would be available or even exist.
 Thanks to all who have contributed (whether knowingly or not) this information and insight into the quirks and problems associated with a Tronxy XY-2 pro printer.
